While I do have some basic github experience, so I already knew about push and pull request and cloning, I learned some new terms such as what forking means and how issues can be used when collaborating with others. The training made me think about how I would use github features to communicate with other collaborators on repositories/projects. It's nice to know I can make a branch to work on edits without affecting the main branch. It's also very relieving that previous versions of the repository are accessible through Github.
